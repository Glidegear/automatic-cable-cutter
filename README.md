# automatic-cable-cutter

releasing the source of automatic-cable-cutter. This resources are the results of a one day kickstarting project. The goal was to get a machine for cutting a number of cables in a certain length. 
Unfortunately i did not spend any time in tidy up the sources. 
Unfortunately some of the parts are not documented, because i used some stuff laying around in my workshop. These parts should be replaced by standard parts.
